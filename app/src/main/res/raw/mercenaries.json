    "name":"Scout",
    "description":"Born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts, the Scout is a fast-running scrapper with a baseball bat and a snarky,in-your-face attitude. He is the fastest and most mobile mercenary on the battlefield unassisted. His Double Jump leaves slower opponents such as the Heavy struggling to keep up and helps him navigate the terrain while dodging oncoming bullets and projectiles. Carrying a Scattergun, a Pistol, and a Bat, the Scout is an ideal class for aggressive fighting and flanking. The Scout is a great class for quick \"hit-and-run\" tactics that can either sap away enemies' health or kill them outright due to his ability to get in, do damage, and dash away before even being noticed. However, the Scout is tied with the Engineer, Sniper, and Spy for having the lowest health of any class, leaving him vulnerable when he is on the front line; a fair trade-off for his ability to run in and out of a contested hot-spot very quickly, letting him lead the team to victory without the other team even noticing in time.\n\nThe Scout is an excellent choice for completing objectives quickly. He can capture control points and push carts at twice the rate of any other class. Only the Scout has this ability naturally; the Demoman and Soldier only have the same ability while holding or using the Pain Train. His speed also makes him perfect for capturing intelligence briefcases.\n\nThe Scout is voiced by Nathan Vetterlein.",

    "description":"The Demoman is a scrumpy-swilling demolitions expert from the Scottish town of Ullapool, and is one of the most versatile members of the team. A master of explosives, the Demoman strategically deals massive amounts of indirect and mid-range splash damage. Armed with his Grenade Launcher and Stickybomb Launcher, the Demoman uses his one good eye and the knowledge of his surrounding environment for well-timed sticky bomb detonations that send enemies skyward, often in many pieces. Should anyone get past his explosive ordinance, however, they will be shocked to learn the Demoman is extremely proficient at melee combat, being one of the deadliest melee users in the game, with a variety of powerful melee unlocks in his arsenal.\n\nThe Demoman excels at swift destruction; he can bounce his grenades at creative angles to wreak havoc on enemy Sentry Gun emplacements while remaining safely out of sight. His sticky bombs are a perfect tool for area denial, and are effective at keeping opponents away from any carts, control points, or Intelligence that he deems off-limits.\n\nThe Demoman is voiced by Gary Schwartz.",

    "name":"Engineer",
    "description":"The Engineer is a soft-spoken, amiable Texan with an interest in all mechanical things. He specializes in constructing and maintaining Buildings that provide support to his team, rather than fighting at the front lines, making him the most suitable for defense. The Engineer's various gadgets include the Sentry Gun, an automated turret that fires at any enemy in range, the Dispenser, a device that restores the health and ammunition of nearby teammates, and Teleporters that quickly transport players from point A to point B.\n\nBecause the Engineer's ingenious devices are under constant threat from explosives and devious enemy Spies, a good Engineer must keep his gear under a watchful eye and under repair with his Wrench at all times. When the Engineer needs to get his hands dirty, his trio of generic yet capable weapons, along with the assistance of his helpful hardware, make him more than capable of holding his own in a fight. If need be, the Engineer can even pick up and haul constructed buildings to redeploy them in more favorable locations. While usually viewed as a defensive class, the Engineer has a selection of high-tech weapons that allow him to destroy projectiles or to build faster-deploying, less damaging Sentry Guns, which give him great utility at the front lines too. His Teleporters are also a key point to both the offensive and defensive team's success, allowing slower, heavier classes to reach the front-lines quicker.\n\nThe Engineer is voiced by Grant Goodeve.",

    "name":"Medic",
    "description":"The Medic is a Teutonic man of medicine. While he may have a tenuous adherence to medical ethics, he is nonetheless the primary healing class of the team. Although the Medic's Syringe Gun and Bonesaw aren't the most excellent weapons for direct combat, he can typically still be found near the front lines, healing wounded teammates while trying to stay out of enemy fire.\n\nWhen the Medic focuses his Medi Gun on a teammate, they will gradually regain health points. Teammates who are already at full health will have their health buffed beyond the standard limit, going up to 150% of their base health capacity (with the exception of weapons that have overheal penalties, such as the Fists of Steel and the Quick-Fix.) Teammates who have not taken damage recently will be healed more rapidly, encouraging other players withdrawals when injured.\n\nWhen healing, the Medic will gradually fill a unique ÜberCharge bar, which can fill faster if healing injured or not-fully-overhealed teammates. When the ÜberCharge bar is fully charged, the Medic's Medi Gun will begin to crackle, accompanied by small electric Team-colored particles at its tip, indicating that he can now deploy a unique charge to benefit his healing target, and himself, for eight seconds. A charge from the Medi Gun offers temporary invulnerability; a charge from the Kritzkrieg grants the Medic and his healing target guaranteed critical hits; the Quick-Fix grants the Medic and his healing target rapid healing, along with immunity to knockback and compression blasts from Pyros; the Vaccinator grants the Medic and his healing target enhanced damage resistance to a specific damage type (bullets, explosives, and fire).\n\nAlthough the Medic cannot heal himself, unless using an ÜberCharge-deployed Quick-Fix, or the Kritzkrieg's Oktoberfest taunt, he is capable of slowly regenerating health over time, and is the only class capable of doing this naturally. The longer a Medic stays out of combat and avoids taking damage, the greater the increments of health he will passively heal. An injured Medic will begin regenerating health at a rate of 3 health points per second, scaling up over the following ten seconds to a maximum of 6 health per second (this base rate can be positively affected by the Amputator and negatively affected by the Blutsauger).\n\nThe Medic is voiced by Robin Atkin Downes.",

    "name":"Sniper",
    "description":"Hailing from the lost country of New Zealand and raised in the unforgiving Australian outback, the Sniper is a tough and ready crack shot. The Sniper's main role on the battlefield is to pick off important enemy targets from afar using his Sniper Rifle and its ability to deal guaranteed critical hits with a headshot (with some exceptions). He is effective at long range, but weakens with proximity, where he is forced to use his Submachine Gun or his Kukri. As a result, the Sniper tends to perch on higher grounds or in hard-to-see places, where he can easily pin down enemies at chokepoints.Although he is typically known for instantaneously killing enemies at a distance, the Sniper can use the Huntsman to get closer to the enemy. Additionally, the Sydney Sleeper and the mysterious contents of Jarate allow him to take on a support role by causing enemies to take mini-crits.\n\nThe Sniper is voiced by John Patrick Lowrie.",

    "name":"Spy",
    "description":"Hailing from an indeterminate region of France, the Spy is an enthusiast of sharp suits and even sharper knives. Using a unique array of cloaking watches, he can render himself invisible or even fake his own death, leaving unaware opponents off-guard. His Disguise Kit lets him take on the form of any class on either team, allowing him to blend in while behind enemy lines before stabbing his unsuspecting \"teammates\" in the back. In fact, a swift backstab with any of the Spy's knives will kill most foes in a single hit - provided they aren't under the effects of any type of invulnerability, or some other form of immense damage reduction.\n\nIn addition to being able to swiftly assassinate key enemies, the Spy possesses the ability to disable and destroy Engineer-constructed buildings with his Sapper. Once attached to an enemy building, the Sapper disables and slowly drains health from the building. However, a Sapper can be removed by an Engineer, or Pyro wielding the Homewrecker, Maul, or Neon Annihilator.\n\nThe Spy, while disguised, has access to enemy Dispensers and Teleporters. This enables him to replenish his health and ammo behind enemy lines and navigate while blending in. Despite being disguised, the Spy will still collide with enemy buildings.\n\nEnemy Medics can both heal and apply ÜberCharge effects to disguised enemy Spies.\n\nWhereas most players can only see the names and health of their teammates, the Spy can observe the names and health of the enemy team as well, allowing him to relay useful intelligence. This ability is unique to only the Spy and a Medic carrying the Solemn Vow.\n\nThe Spy is voiced by Dennis Bateman.",
